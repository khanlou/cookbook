        <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
          <li>.25 cups cold beef tallow</li>
          <li>3/4 cups of cold water</ul>

          <li>Place flour and salt in the workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse to combine.</li>
          <li>Add tallow and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water and process until a cohesive dough forms.</li>
          <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Divide dough into 10 equal pieces; roll each piece of dough into a ball. Cover dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rest an additional 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Heat cast iron skillet, griddle, or comal over medium-high heat.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, place one ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface and pat down into a flat disc. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out to a very thin 8-inch round.</li>
          <li>Place dough in skillet and cook until bubbles form on top side and bottom side has light browned spots, 15-30 seconds. Flip tortilla and cook until second side develops light browned spots, 15-30 seconds longer. Transfer tortilla to a plate and cover with dish cloth.</li>
          <li>Repeat with remaining balls of dough.</li>
          <li>Serve immediately while still warm.</li>
