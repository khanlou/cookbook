title: Pasta Dough
layout: recipe
description: Traditional dry pasta is made with only flour and water. Making fresh pasta only takes about an hour, and eggs add so much depth that you'd be happy to just eat it by itself.

ingredients: 
  - 10 ounces (about 2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
  - 2 whole large eggs (about 4 ounces)
  - 4 yolks from 4 large eggs (about 2.5 ounces)
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for salting water
instructions:
  - The dough should be roughly 53% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage">hydration</a>. To attain this consistency, measure the weight of the whole eggs and the yolks, and divide this number by 0.53 to get the weight of the flour that you will need. If you don't have a scale, you can use the given measurement.
  - In a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, add flour, whole eggs, egg yolks, and salt. The dough will slowly come together. It will look too dry, but trust the hydration percentage. It will come together. You may need to turn off the mixer and push things together a little with your hands to move the process along.
  - Mix for about 10 minutes on low until it is smooth and stretchy with a uniform yellow color.
  - Wrap ball of dough tightly in plastic wrap and rest on countertop for 30 minutes.
  - Divide the dough into balls roughly the size of golf balls. Feed them into the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KPEXTA-Stand-Mixer-Pasta-Extruder-Attachment/dp/B003GWZ9ZK">pasta press.</a>
  - Divide the extruded noodles into individual portions, dust lightly with flour, and curl into a nest. Place on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and gently cover with kitchen towel until ready to cook. Putting weight on the pasta will cause the noodles to stick together. Pasta can be frozen directly on the baking sheet, transferred to a zipper-lock freezer bag, and stored in the freezer for up to three weeks before cooking. Cook frozen pasta directly from the freezer.
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add pasta, stir gently with a wooden spoon, chopsticks, or a cooking fork, and cook, tasting at regular intervals until noodles are just set with a definite bite, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Drain, toss with sauce, and serve.
