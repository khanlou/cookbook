title: Crispy Pancakes
layout: recipe
description: The extra milk makes these pancakes run a lot more, giving them really thin edges. When fried in oil, they become super crispy and very delicious.
ingredients: 
  - 1.5 cups flour
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1/2 tsp baking soda
  - 3 Tbs sugar
  - 2 eggs
  - 3 cups milk
  - 3 Tbs butter, melted
  - vegetable oil
instructions:
  - Place a large pan or griddle over medium heat. Apply generous oil. You’re pretty much going to fry these pankcakes.
  - In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and sugar.
  - Make a well in the center and add the eggs, milk and butter. Whisk together until thoroughly mixed. The mixture should be very soupy.
  - Test your griddle using a small amount of batter — make sure that the griddle is hot enough.
  - Pour out pancakes (about 1/4 cup at a time), and flip once the bottom has turned a golden brown. One the other side is cooked, serve topped with butter and syrup.
