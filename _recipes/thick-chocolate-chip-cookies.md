title: Thick Chocolate Chip Cookies
layout: recipe
description: These cookies are based on cookies from a NYC bakery called Levain. They make them with walnuts but I think they're better without.

ingredients: 
  - 3 1/8 cups all purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - ¼ teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
  - 1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes
  - 7/8 cup (6 ounces) light or dark brown sugar
  - ½ cup granulated sugar
  - 2 eggs, cold, lightly beaten in a separate bowl
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 2 cups dark chunky chocolate chips
instructions:
  - Line a large baking sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper. Set aside.
  - In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, powder, and salt. Set aside.
  - In a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter until it comes together in one lump, about 1 minute. Add in the sugars and beat for another 1-2 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves into the butter.
  - Lower the speed to medium-low, and mix in the eggs and vanilla and beat until mixed (the batter will be lumpy). Gradually add in the flour mixture, beating until a little flour remains. Add the chocolate chips and mix until they're uniformly distributed.
  - Divide the dough into 12 even pieces. Shape the dough roughly into a ball, but do not roll it. Place on the prepared baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate them overnight.
  - Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake cookies for 15-20 minutes, until light golden brown. When in doubt, take your cookies out early. The cookies will continue to cook as they cool. There's nothing that ruins them more than being overcooked.
